ofxPointer
==========

A framework to unify openFrameworks pointer events into a single WC3-pointerevents/MSPointer-like interface.


The goal is to have something that unites pointer events in openFrameworks to work like these: 

http://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/hh673557(v=vs.85).aspx

This will ease gui development, interaction, etc.
